                Victoria joined Coobo in 2015, bringing with her considerable
                web design talents. Originally from Taiwan, she attended school
                in the states and graduated from the University of Houston with
                a Bachelor of Arts in Art Education. After graduation, Victoria
                spent 1Â½ years working with middle school computer and art
                students at the Harmony School of Science. But the
                self-proclaimed geek found her true passion during an internship
                at a web design startup. Victoria, who also answers to, Vickie,
                was a bit of tomboy as a child and now she channels her athletic
                tendencies into outdoor activities and cheering for our Houston
                Astros.
